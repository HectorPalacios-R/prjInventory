## What are pointer types?
#### Pointer types are variables that store memory addresses
## When are pointer types used?
### They are used in programming when direct manipulation of memory addresses is required or beneficial. They are rarely used because the C# is designed to be safe and managed but if they are used they will be used in image and video processing
## Why do they require unsafe context?
### They require an unsafe context because they allow direct memory manipulation, bypassing the safety features provided by the .NET runtime
